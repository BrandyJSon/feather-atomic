Feather uses monero-seed written by Tevador, for 14 word mnemonic seeds.

Initial CMake support for the Monero GUI was coded by TheCharlatan/xiphon.

The wallet UI is heavily inspired by Electrum. We would like to recognize Thomas Voegtlin for his pioneering work on Bitcoin.

Huge thanks to nioc, fluffypony, wowario, thrmo for help during development.
