• The wallet UI is heavily inspired by Electrum. We would like to recognize Thomas Voegtlin for his pioneering work on Bitcoin.

• Feather uses the monero-seed libary written by Tevador for 14 word mnemonic seeds.

• Wizard banner art was adapted from a paper wallet design by the themonera (themonera.art).

• Uses icons from the Icons8 icon pack (icons8.com).

• Initial CMake support for the Monero GUI was coded by TheCharlatan/xiphon.
